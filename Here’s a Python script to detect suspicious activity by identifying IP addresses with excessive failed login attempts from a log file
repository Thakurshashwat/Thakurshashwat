Example Output:

Suspicious Activity Detected:
IP Address           Failed Login Attempts
192.168.1.100        56
203.0.113.34         12

Configurable Threshold:
Change the threshold parameter to adjust the number of failed login attempts required to flag an IP as suspicious. Replace 'example.log' with your log file's path and run the script to analyze suspicious activity.
